[![Watch the video](https://github.com/ozrenv/LegoAssemblyURVision/blob/master/youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t85DS-9UNHM)

This repository contains a simulation with two integral parts: image processing and robot programming using RoboDK. The image processing program, `main.py`, takes an input image of bricks on the workspace and generates five CSV files with brick information (x, y coordinates, and orientation).

### Dependencies
To run the simulation and the Python program, ensure the following is installed:

- [RoboDK](https://robodk.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (or a similar IDE)
- Python packages: OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Csv

Feel free to clone the repository and explore the code for a deeper understanding. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
